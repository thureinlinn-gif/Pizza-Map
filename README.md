CI 103 Computing and Informatics Design III Project

🍕 Pizza Map
Overview

Pizza Map is an interactive web project that showcases some of the best pizza spots across the United States. The project is inspired by the famous pizza reviews of Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports, who has reviewed over 1,000 pizza shops nationwide. The website offers an engaging experience where users can explore different pizza locations through an interactive map, view Dave’s ratings, and share their own feedback on each shop.

Features

⭐ Dave’s Ratings: Each location displays Dave Portnoy’s official review and score.

💬 User Feedback: Visitors can share their own comments and experiences about each pizza place.

🧭 Navigation Bar: A simple and user-friendly navigation bar located at the top left corner links to the Home, About Us, and Contact Us pages.

👀 Street View Integration: Users can explore the surroundings of each pizza shop through Google Street View for an immersive experience.
